### fl0

This is the starting out point

### fl1

This isn't used but adds in the doc/modules files.

### fl2

This is a working version with nothing in the drawer.  But the drawer
comes up blank.

### fl3

Change the way the drawer works.  Instead of using the context which
is more like a global system.  Start out with the routes in the component
and pass them into the RrDrawer as a prop.  Meaning that each component
can have a different set of routes.
